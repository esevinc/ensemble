# ensemble

All the codes are *.ipynb jupyter notebook files and they have been run in the Google Colab environment with GPU hardware accelerator.
Because of that, to run the codes, you have to change the all paths in the first box written as;

data = pd.read_csv('cvd/data1.csv') 
in which all related ***.csv files are provided in the dataset directory. All CSV files are obtained separately

There are 2 different *.ipynb files. One for "Correlation and  Variance Threshold" alg. and one for IG, Fisher Score  and Chi Sq. algorithms. All algorithms are excuted in a 5-fold CV excution

Datasets are in the dataset folder (cvd folder). This dataset is also available in "https://github.com/Atharva-Peshkar/Covid-19-Patient-Health-Analytics".
